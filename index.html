                <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="primary-paragraph">
                <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on (15 October 1931) to a Tamil Muslim family in the
                    pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State
                    of
                    Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabudeen was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;his mother Ashiamma
                    was
                    a housewife.His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and
                    the
                    now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.
                    His
                    ancestors had been wealthy traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of
                    land.
                    Their business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from
                    Sri
                    Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a result, the family
                    acquired
                    the title of "Mara Kalam iyakkivar" (wooden boat steerers), which over the years became shortened to
                    "Marakier." With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses
                    failed and the family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the ancestral home. By
                    his
                    early childhood, Kalam's family had become poor; at an early age, he sold newspapers to supplement
                    his
                    family's income. In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and
                    hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially
                    mathematics. After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram,
                    Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University
                    of
                    Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace
                    engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the
                    Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the
                    project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who
                    later
                    said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline".He
                    narrowly
                    missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only
                    eight
                    positions were available in the IAF.

                <h3>Career as a Scientist</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="primary-paragraph">
                <p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
                    Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as a
                    scientist. He
                    started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job
                    at
                    DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned
                    space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
                    where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which
                    successfully
                    deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an
                    expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.In 1969, Kalam received the government's
                    approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.Kalam addresses engineering students
                    at IIT Guwahati In 1963–64, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard
                    Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.Between the 1970s and
                    1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III
                    projects,
                    both of which proved to be successful. Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's
                    first
                    nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in
                    its
                    development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant,
                    which
                    sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme.Despite
                    the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these
                    aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship.Kalam played an
                    integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace
                    projects.His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the
                    1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his
                    directorship.Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence
                    Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for
                    simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after
                    another.R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating ₹388 crores
                    for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam
                    as
                    the chief executive.Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission
                    including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface
                    missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time
                    overruns.Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and the Secretary
                    of the Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II
                    nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political and
                    technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala
                    Chidambaram,
                    during the testing phase. Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country's best
                    known nuclear scientist.However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam, said that the
                    thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticisied Kalam for issuing an incorrect report.Both
                    Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam
                    developed a low cost coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju Stent".In 2012, the duo designed a
                    rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet"

                <h3>Presidency</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="primary-paragraph">
                <p>Kalam served as the 11th President of India succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002
                    presidentialelection with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi
                    Sahgal. His term
                    lasted from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007. On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)
                    which was in power at the time, expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the post of
                    President, and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his
                    candidacy. After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to
                    seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear.Kalam said of the announcement of his
                    candidature: I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been
                    asked
                    for a message. I was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at this juncture.
                    On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee and
                    his
                    senior Cabinet colleagues. Kalam along with Vladimir Putin and Manmohan Singh during his presidency
                    The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002 in Parliament and the state
                    assemblies,
                    with the media claiming that the election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory was a foregone
                    conclusion; the count was held on 18 July.Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India
                    in an easy victory,and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25 July.
                    Kalam was the third President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest
                    civilian honour, before becoming the President. Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Dr Zakir
                    Hussain
                    (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the President of India. He was
                    also the first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan. During his term as
                    president, he was affectionately known as the People's President, saying that signing the
                    Office of Profit Bill was the toughest decision he had taken during his tenure.Kalam was
                    criticised for his inaction in deciding the fate of 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to
                    him
                    during his tenure.Article 72 of the Constitution of India empowers the President of India to grant
                    pardons, and suspend or commute the death sentence of convicts on death row. Kalam acted on only
                    one mercy plea in his five-year tenure as president, rejecting the plea of rapist Dhananjoy
                    Chatterjee,
                    who was later hanged. Perhaps the most notable plea was from Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri terrorist who
                    was convicted of conspiracy in the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament and was sentenced
                    to
                    death by the Supreme Court of India in 2004.While the sentence was scheduled to be carried out on
                    20 October 2006, the pending action on his mercy plea resulted in him remaining on death row.He
                    also took the controversial decision to impose President's Rule in Bihar in 2005.In September 2003,
                    in an interactive session in PGI Chandigarh, Kalam supported the need of Uniform Civil Code in
                    India,
                    keeping in view the population of the country. At the end of his term, on 20 June 2007,
                    Kalam expressed his willingness to consider a second term in office provided there was certainty
                    about
                    his victory in the 2007 presidential election. However, two days later, he decided not to contest
                    the Presidential election again stating that he wanted to avoid involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from
                    any
                    political processes.He did not have the support of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA
                    constituents, to receive a renewed mandate.Nearing the expiry of the term of the 12th President
                    Pratibha Patil on 24 July 2012, media reports in April claimed that Kalam was likely to be nominated
                    for
                    his second term.After the reports, social networking sites witnessed a number of people
                    supporting his candidature.The BJP potentially backed his nomination, saying that the party
                    would lend their support if the Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party and Indian National Congress
                    proposed him for the 2012 presidential election. A month ahead of the election, Mulayam Singh
                    Yadav and Mamata Banerjee also expressed their support for Kalam.Days afterwards, Mulayam Singh
                    Yadav backed out, leaving Mamata Banerjee as the solitary supporter. On 18 June 2012, Kalam declined
                    to contest the 2012 presidential poll. He said of his decision not to do so: Many, many citizens
                    have
                    also expressed the same wish. It only reflects their love and affection for me and the aspiration of
                    the
                    people. I am really overwhelmed by this support. This being their wish, I respect it. I want to
                    thank
                    them for the trust they have in me.

                <h3>Death</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="primary-paragraph">
                <p>On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet
                    Earth" at
                    the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some
                    discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only
                    five
                    minutes into his lecture, he collapsed,He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical
                    condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life.Despite being placed in the
                    intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m IST. His last
                    words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?" Following his
                    death, Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong to Guwahati, from
                    where it was flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July in an air force C-130J Hercules. The
                    flight
                    landed at Palam Air Base that afternoon and was received by the President, the Prime Minister, Chief
                    Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, and the three service chiefs of the Indian Armed Forces, who laid
                    wreaths on Kalam's body.His body was then placed on a gun carriage draped with the Indian flag and
                    taken
                    to his Delhi residence at 10 Rajaji Marg; there, the public and numerous dignitaries paid homage,
                    including former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-President
                    Rahul
                    Gandhi, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. On the morning of 29 July, Kalam's body,
                    wrapped in the Indian flag, was taken to Palam Air Base and flown to Madurai in an air force C-130J
                    aircraft, arriving at Madurai Airport that afternoon. His body was received at the airport by the
                    three
                    service chiefs and national and state dignitaries, including cabinet ministers Manohar Parrikar,
                    Venkaiah Naidu, Pon Radhakrishnan and the governors of Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya, K Rosaiah and V.
                    Shanmuganathan. After a brief ceremony, Kalam's body was flown by air force helicopter to the town
                    of
                    Mandapam, from where it was taken in an army truck to his hometown of Rameswaram. Upon arriving at
                    Rameswaram, his body was displayed in an open area in front of the local bus station to allow the
                    public
                    to pay their final respects until 8 p.m. that evening.On 30 July 2015, the former President was laid
                    to
                    rest at Rameswaram's Pei Karumbu Ground with full state honours. Over 350,000 people attended the
                    last
                    rites, including the Prime Minister, the governor of Tamil Nadu and the chief ministers of
                    Karnataka,
                    Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.
